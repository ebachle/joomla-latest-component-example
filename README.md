Joomla! latest Hello World component example
================================

What is it?
---------------------------------------
Just a simple Joomla 1.7 Hello World extension

Goals
--------------
The idea is to keep a working Hello World component example that always works with the latest version of Joomla

How do I use it?
-----------------------------
Use phing to install package and install it on your site.

**`Phing`**: If you don't have Phing installed, get it *[here](http://phing.info/trac/)*. From the repository root:

	phing -f build/build.xml
	
That should create a folder at phing/packages with an installable zip.
